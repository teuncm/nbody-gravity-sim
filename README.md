The simulation runs straight out of the box in your browser by opening index.html. Matter.js handles all collisions and integrations, while Newtonian gravity was implemented using the wikipedia on [Newton's law of universal gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation).

Future plans:
* Render using WebGL with PixiJS
* Implement Barnes-Hut to reduce complexity to O(n log n)
